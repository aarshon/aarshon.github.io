My name is Aarshon, and this project is part of my junior year Engineering showcase. Our mission is to design and deliver a STEM-themed, interactive, web-enabled device that inspires K-12 students to explore science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).  </p> <p>Welcome to my Embedded Systems HMI Subsystem project for EGR314. I am developing an interactive Human-Machine Interface (HMI) as part of a larger weather station system. This HMI will provide real-time data display and user input functionality, ensuring seamless interaction with the system\u2019s environmental sensors and power management units. My design leverages a PIC18F47Q10 microcontroller, a membrane keypad for user input, and an OLED display for data visualization. The system is engineered with a focus on energy efficiency, modularity, and intuitive usability, making it suitable for STEM education applications.</p>"},{"location":"#mission-statement","title":"Mission Statement","text":"<p>Our team aims to develop an interactive, STEM-themed educational display that engages K-12 students by showcasing real-time weather data through an intuitive HMI.
